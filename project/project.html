              It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in
              December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
            </p>
            <p>
              Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
              cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
              severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
              respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include
              regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and
              sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact
              with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as
              coughing and sneezing.

            and begin gradually. Also the symptoms may appear 2-14 days after

                          People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about
                          friends and relatives who are living in or visiting
                          areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are
                          worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead
                          to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or
                          other Asian Americans or people who were in
                          quarantine.

                          Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group
                          of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated
                          with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a
                          need to blame someone, fears about disease and death,
                          and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                          Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger

                          Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some
                          cause illness in people, and others, such as canine
                          and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely,
                          animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged
                          to infect people and can spread between people. This
                          is suspected to have occurred for the virus that
                          causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
                          (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
                          are two other examples of coronaviruses that
                          originated from animals and then spread to people.
                          More information about the source and spread of

                          This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei
                          Province, China. The first infections were linked to a
                          live animal market, but the virus is now spreading
                          from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                          person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum.
                          Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles),
                          while other viruses are less so.

                          Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread
                          the illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that
                          these patients be isolated either in the hospital or
                          at home (depending on how sick they are) until they
                          are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting

                          doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                          person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                          Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
                          of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                          eating food it is important to always wash your hands
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                          safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                          blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                          the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                          touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                          and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                          their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                          the virus spreads.

                          In general, because of poor survivability of these
                          coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low
                          risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                          are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                          refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                              instructions for medication(s) and care. You
                              should help the patient with basic needs in the
                              home and provide support for getting groceries,

                              Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is
                              getting sicker, call his or her healthcare
                              provider and tell them that the patient has
                              laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the
                              healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep
                              other people in the office or waiting room from
                              getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to
                              call the local or state health department for
                              additional guidance. If the patient has a medical
                              emergency and you need to call 911, notify the
                              dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is
                              being evaluated for COVID-19.

                              or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that
                              contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces
                              of your hands and rubbing them together until they
                              feel dry. Soap and water should be used
                              preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.

                              wear a facemask (for example, because it causes
                              trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should

                          COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take
                          everyday precautions to keep space between yourself
                          and others; when you go out in public, keep away from
                          others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your
                          hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and
                          non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your
                          community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for
                          symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay
                          home and call your doctor. More information on how to

                          The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
                          tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
                          and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
                          or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin
                          gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
                          develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most
                          people (about 80%) recover from the disease without
                          needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                          people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and
                          develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those
                          with underlying medical problems like high blood
                          pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely
                          to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough
                          and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                          attention.

                          This is a new virus and we are still learning about
                          it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of
                          illness in children. Most illness, including serious
                          illness, is happening in adults of working age and
                          older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact
                          your child’s school, the school may dismiss students.
                          Keep track of school dismissals in your community.
                          Read or watch local media sources that report school
                          dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use
                          alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                          If your child/children become sick with COVID-19,
                          notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with
                          teachers about classroom assignments and activities
                          they can do from home to keep up with their
                          schoolwork.

                          Discourage children and teens from gathering in other
                          public places while school is dismissed to help slow
                          the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                          Depending on the situation, public health officials
                          may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to
                          COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch
                          local media sources that report school dismissals or
                          and watch for communication from your child’s school.

                          Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                          person-to-person through respiratory droplets.
                          Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
                          of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or
                          eating food it is important to always wash your hands
                          with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
                          safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                          blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to
                          the bathroom.

                          It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                          touching a surface or object that has the virus on it
                          and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                          their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way
                          the virus spreads.

                          In general, because of poor survivability of these
                          coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low
                          risk of spread from food products or packaging that
                          are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                          refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                            Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people
                            who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than

                            takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are
                            infected become sick and develop a fever.

                            No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal
                            vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib)
                            vaccine, do not provide protection against the new

                            The virus is so new and different that it needs its
                            own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a
                            vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting
                            their efforts.

                            2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses
                            is highly recommended to protect your health.
